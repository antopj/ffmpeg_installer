# ffmpeg_installer And Uninstaller
ffmpeg_installer for CentOS_6.x (Tested) . Created based on ffmpeg official documentation


*********I've created these scripts based on official documentation provided by FFMPEG.ORG***********

It is highly recommended to test this script in a fresh server.

Remove all binaries and libraries which are related to ffmpeg if you have tried any other installations. Better if you can have a new/fresh server.


*************I won't ne responsible for any of the issues caused by the libraries or installation.***********

***Don't hesistate to let me know if you face any issues, I will help you if you enounters any issues.. :) (I hope) :)
